\section{Why Carpentries training?}

\begin{frame}{The `reproducibility crisis'}
  For nearly a decade the reproducibility crisis has featured in the scientific literature \cite{Jasny2011-bw, Baker2016-cf, Munafo2017-bj}. Low reproducibility rates have emerged from large-scale studies:
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
        \item Results from only 39\% of psychology studies could be reproduced \cite{Open_Science_Collaboration2015-vf}.
        \item Even lower reproducibility rate in biomedical research \cite{Begley2012-xt,Prinz2011-za}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Calls for rigour and transparency}
  Manifestos, statements, and guides to good practice:
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
        \item \textbf{OECD Priniples and Guidelines for Access to Research Data} \cite{Oecd2007-vi}.
        \item \textbf{Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data} \cite{Wilkinson2016-mr, Go-fair2017-vs}.
        \item \textbf{Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines} \cite{Nosek2015-wm, Cos2019-mr}.
        \item \textbf{Data transparency toolkit} \cite{Perkel2018-rw} provides a snapshot of emerging good practice.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{From guidelines to mandates}
  Mandates for transparency or reproducibility:
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
        \item \textbf{Nature}: Transparency Upgrade \cite{Nature2017-lq}.
        \item \textbf{Nature}: FAIR data in Earth science \cite{Nature2019-ng}.
        \item \textbf{Copernicus}: FAIR data in atmospheric sciences \cite{Van_Edig2018-bu}.
        \item \textbf{TOP Guidelines} signatories include publishers representing \textbf{1000+ journals}, as well as professional organisations and \textbf{private foundations}  \cite{Cos2019-mr}.

\begin{frame}{Level 2 TOP Guidelines for authors (excerpt)}
  
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
        \setcounter{enumi}{1}
        % This increments the enumerate counter by 1.
        
        \item Authors using original data must:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
            \item \textbf{make the data available} at a trusted digital repository [...]
            \item include all variables, treatment conditions, and observations described in the manuscript.
            \item \textbf{provide a full account of the procedures} used to collect, preprocess, clean, or generate the data.
            \item \textbf{provide program code}, scripts, codebooks, and other documentation sufficient to precisely reproduce all published results.
            \item \textbf{provide research materials and description of procedures} necessary to conduct an independent replication of the research.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Australia: Data sharing in the NHMRC Statement}
    The NHMRC `strongly encourages' data sharing in the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research and their Open Access Policy. \cite{Nhmrc2018-sj, Nhmrc2018-vn} \par
    National Statement 3.1.50 \par
    In the absence of justifiable ethical reasons (such as respect for cultural ownership or unmanageable risks to the privacy of research participants) and to promote access to the benefits of research, researchers should collect and store data or information generated by research projects in such a way that they can be used in future research projects. Where a researcher believes there are valid reasons for not making data or information accessible, this must be justified.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Carpentries as fundamental training}
     The \textbf{legal, ethical, publisher, and funder compliance environment is changing} so fast that training addressed at compliance alone quickly becomes outdated, and learning by rote becomes unworkable (or at least very inefficient). \par
     To meet these challenges, \textbf{research training needs to include fundamental digital skills} that provide a basis to meet rapidly changing expectations. \par
     \textbf{Reproducibility and transparency} have irreducible technological demands. \par
     \textbf{Robust, high-impact research} addressing `grand challenges'  requires data synthesis and scalable approaches to research have  irreducible technological demands.
\end{frame}

\begin{comment}

\begin{frame}{NHMRC Open Access Policy 2018 changes}
    Key changes to the Open Access Policy (15 January 2018) \par
    Research data and metadata (2.2) \par
    NHMRC now strongly encourages researchers to take reasonable steps to share research data and associated metadata arising from NHMRC supported research.\par
    FAIR principles (2.7) \par
    Reference to the Australian F.A.I.R. principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) when publishing research literature and sharing data has been made.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{NHMRC Open Access Policy data sharing}
    Medatdata (4.1) \par
    The metadata for the peer-reviewed publication must be made openly accessible via an institutional repository as soon as possible but no later than 3 months from the date of publication. \par
    Data (4.2) \par
    NHMRC acknowledges the importance of making research data publicly accessible and therefore strongly encourages researchers to consider the reuse value of their data and to take reasonable steps to share research data and associated metadata arising from NHMRC supported research.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Legal compliance}
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
        \item NSW General Retention and Disposal Authority GDA 23; data associated with `significant' research or researchers must be kept forever (23.6.1) \cite{Nsw2015-kv}
        \item NSW Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 No 133, esp. Part 2, Division 1, Section 19, which flags indicators of high sensitivity and establishes data sovereignty.\cite{Nsw1998-mw} Compare the (Australian) Privacy Act 1988, esp. Part II, Division 1, Section 6 `Sensitive Information' and Schedule 1, and `Australian Privacy Principles', Section 8, which covers some university-controlled entities. \cite{Ag2017-oz,Oaic2019-ng}
        \item NSW Notifiable Data Breach guidance \cite{Ipc_nsw2018-yr}; see also the Australian Notifiable Data Breaches scheme \cite{Oaic2019-dq}
        \item EU General Data Protection Regulation \cite{Gdpr2019-ee}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Beyond compliance}

\begin{frame}{Large-scale research}
    The same approaches that facilitate transparency and reproducibility support the kind of scalable and synthetic research that can address archaeological `grand challenges'. \cite{Kintigh2014-ub}
        \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item Paper data capture and manual digitisation and cleaning don't scale.
            \item Collaboration based on email and desktop software doesn't scale.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Scalable approaches to data and analysis}
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[height=.7\textheight]{figures/Ocean-Health-Index.jpg}
        \caption{Better science in less time, illustrated by the Ocean Health Index project. \cite{Stewart_Lowndes2017-lj}}
        \label{fig:stewart_lowndes}
  \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\section{From current practice to better practice}

\begin{frame}{What does this mean? Are we ready?}
  Emerging good practice - and publisher and funder policies - mean:
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
        \item Comprehensive, FAIR datasets will be deposited in domain-specific repositories. Data, and especially metadata, quality will be higher.
        \item Data will be captured digitally as early in research as possible, and provenance / version history maintained.
        \item Research approach, processes, and procedures will be documented.
        \item Data processing and analysis will use code (not Excel!) 
        \item Code will be documented and published for reuse.
        \item Further steps taken for analytical reproducibility (use of OSS, version control, automation, containerisation, etc.). 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Challenges and paths forward}
  How do we get from where we are now to where we want to be?
      \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
        \item Understand the evolving expectations of transparent research. 
        \item Pursue proper training
        \item Look past desktop software (Excel, ARCGIS, Filemaker, Access, etc.).
        \item Use emerging research- and domain-specific solutions (even if imperfect).
        \item Overcome `not invented here'; if a solution exists, use it.
        \item Budget for `ground-up' transparency (data and code). Up-front costs will be high but offer longer-term payoffs (in costs, time, and quality).
        \item Implement (and budget for) fundamental good practice in data and code management before other technologies.
        \item Improve research design (prioritise approach over methods) \cite{Muthukrishna2019-kt, Hole1973-cy}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{What is Carpentries training?}

\begin{frame}{Aims of Carpentries training}
  \textbf{Software Carpentry} \cite{The_Carpentries2019-ej}
  \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
    \item `teach[es] researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain'
    \item `covers the core skills needed to be productive in a small research team'
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Data Carpentry} \cite{The_Carpentries2019-aa}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item `covers the core skills needed to be productive in a small research team'
    \item `high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research'
    \item `\textit{Our initial target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience}' (emphasis in original)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Delivery of Carpentries training}
  \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
    \item \textbf{Two-day workshops} run by (volunteer) certified instructors, with co-instructors or helpers to ensure sufficient support for learners.
    \item Beginner workshops \textbf{assume no experience}.
    \item Beginner workshops \textbf{build confidence}.
    \item Workshops follow the principal of '\textbf{no one left behind}'.
    \item Workshops are \textbf{community maintained an openly licensed}.
    \item Proven success: Over \textbf{32,000 learners} have been trained at more than \textbf{1,200 workshops} since 2012.
    \item Recommended by (e.g.) 'A toolkit for data transparency' in \textit{Nature} \cite{Perkel2018-rw}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Carpentries training at Macquarie}

\begin{frame}{Workshops and learners}
  \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
    \item \textbf{12 Workshops} offered since mid-2017.
    \item Over \textbf{500 learners} trained.
    \item Pool of about \textbf{20 instructors} developed.
    \item First '\textbf{Instructor trainers}' certified in 2019, so we can train our own instructors (and provide that service more broadly).
    \item In 2019, \textbf{Data Carpentry integrated into two Masters of Research units}, one in Science and one in Arts.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reflection on Carpentries training}
  \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
    \item Effectively \textbf{trains researchers beyond compliance}.
    \item \textbf{Well received in STEM} disciplines - we need to \textbf{deliver more} and engage in routine outreach.
    \item In \textbf{HASS disciplines}, response ranges from \textbf{indifference to hostility} (few HASS learners; students in the Arts MRes unit rebelled) - we need to \textbf{change hearts and minds}.
    \item \textbf{Community of practice} emerging: `\textbf{Pipeline}' from learners to helpers to instructors, \textbf{user groups} spawned / strengthened.
    \item \textbf{Volunteer basis of operation may not be sustainable}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Changes coming to HASS disciplines}
  HASS HDR students (and researchers) unprepared for the emerging world of Open Scholarship, which demands technical skills:
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
        \item \textbf{American Journal of Political Science} requires (and tests) data and code \cite{Jacoby2017-lw, Ajps2015-ex}.
        \item \textbf{All European Academies (allea)} E-Humanities working group \cite{Allea2019-wy} has issued an Open Consultation on `Sustainable and FAIR Data Sharing in the Humanities' \cite{Allea2019-aw}.
        \item \textbf{Allea} seeks to address the imperatives of the `\textbf{Open Science agenda}' across Humanities and Social Sciences, and `facilitate the adoption of Open Science across the Humanities'.
        \item \textbf{Research Data Alliance} (RDA) has an 'Ambassador for the Humanities' and is examining how RDA standards and outputs can apply to humanities disciplines \cite{Rda2019-wc}.
    \end{itemize}
